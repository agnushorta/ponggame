#Pong Game

Based on [Pong Game Tutorial](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/tutorials/pong.html) using Kivy.

### To do

- Add some nicer graphics / images. (Hint: check out the source property on the graphics instructions like circle or Rectangle, to set an image as the texture.)

- Make the game end after a certain score. Maybe once a player has 10 points, you can display a large “PLAYER 1 WINS” label and/or add a main menu to start, pause and reset the game. (Hint: check out the Button and Label classes, and figure out how to use their add_widget and remove_widget functions to add or remove widgets dynamically.

- Make it a 4 player Pong Game. Most tablets have Multi-Touch support, so wouldn’t it be cool to have a player on each side and have four people play at the same time?

- Fix the simplistic collision check so hitting the ball with an end of the paddle results in a more realistic bounce.
